# Tedlium2 ASR with Transformers
This folder contains the scripts to train a Transformer-based speech recognizer.

You can download Tedlium2 at https://lium.univ-lemans.fr/ted-lium2/

Please first train the tokenizer:

```shell
cd ../../Tokenizer
python train.py hyperparams/tedlium2_500_bpe.yaml
```

**Note:** The training script will divide the entire TED recording into individual utterance-level recordings, resulting in approximately 46 gigabytes of data. To save time and storage space during ASR data preparation, you can specify the `clipped_utt_folder` in the `hparams/branchformer_large.yaml` hyperparameter file to point to the same location as the `clipped_utt_folder` used during BPE training.


# How to run
```shell
python train.py hparams/branchformer.yaml
```
