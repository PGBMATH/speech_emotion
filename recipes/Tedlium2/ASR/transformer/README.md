# Tedlium2 ASR with Transformers
This folder contains the scripts to train a Transformer-based speech recognizer.

You can download Tedlium2 at https://lium.univ-lemans.fr/ted-lium2/

Please first check ../../Tokenizer. ../../Tokenizer/train.py. It will split the whole Ted recording into utterances-level recorderings, which will generate about 46G data. For data preparetion of ASR, to avoid genereting utterances-level recorderings again and to save space, you may would like to point "clipped_utt_folder" in "hparams/branchformer_large.yaml to the "clipped_utt_folder" of the BPE training.

# How to run
```shell
python ../../Tokenizer/train.py ../../Tokenizer/hparams/tedlium2_500_bpe.yaml
python train.py hparams/branchformer.yaml
```
