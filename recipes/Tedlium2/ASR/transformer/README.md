# Tedlium2 ASR with Transformers
This folder contains the scripts to train a Transformer-based speech recognizer.

You can download Tedlium2 at https://lium.univ-lemans.fr/ted-lium2/

# How to Run:

1. Begin by training the tokenizer:

```shell
cd ../../Tokenizer
python train.py hyperparams/tedlium2_500_bpe.yaml
```

Please, read  ../../Tokenizer/README.md before proceeding.
This training script will handle data preparation and tokenizer training. Note that this script prepares the data in a format suitable for training the ASR model. 
Specifically, it segments the entire TED recording into individual utterance-level recordings, resulting in approximately 46 gigabytes of data. 
The CSV files generated for training, development, and testing are also utilized in ASR training.
 
**IMPORTANT:** Rnsure you complete this step before proceeding to train the ASR Model.

2. Proceed to train the ASR model:

```shell
python train.py hparams/branchformer_large.yaml 
```

This script relies on the data manifest files prepared in step 1.
