# MOS Estimation (with SOMOS)
This folder contains the recipes for training TTS evaluation systems trained on LJSpeech using the Samsung Open MOS Dataset (SOMOS)

# Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from here:
https://zenodo.org/records/7378801

# Installing Extra Dependencies

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed the necessary additional dependencies. To do this, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
```
# TTS Evaluation Model

The model is based loosely on the baseline model described in the VoiceMOS 2022 challenge described in the paper below:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11389.pdf

It is based on the same principle: the weights of the base self-supervised representation model are updated in order
to fine-tune it to the quality assessment task. Linear regression between human and model ratings is used for
assessment.

Additional enhancements have been added. The updated model featured a shallow encoder-only Tranformer before the pooling
layer in order to introduce an attention mechanism.

To run this recipe, run the following command

```
python train.py --device=cuda:0  --data_folder=/your_folder/SOMOS hparams/train_ssl_wavlm_xformer.yaml
```
