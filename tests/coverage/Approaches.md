# What coverage approaches are needed?

1. Dependencies: version control (check commit ID dates)
  <br/> see: [requirements.txt](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/requirements.txt)
  <br/> run: `find *txt . | grep extra`
2. Docstring tests: commented function signatures <br/>_(of functions intended for outer calls)_
3. [Unittests](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/develop/tests/unittests) per function-critical code block
4. [Integration tests](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/develop/tests/integration) for vanilla experiments to cover use-cases on a generic task basis
5. Advanced testing: standing interfaces & their refactoring
6. Linters for automated style checks & corrections of python & yaml code

## Where to get things done?

1. Raise your questions & engage in [Discussions](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/discussions)
2. Report a bug or request a feature, open [Issues](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/issues/new/choose)
3. Contribute [Pull requests](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/pulls)
4. Release pretrained models through SpeechBrain
   <br/> e.g. registering linking HuggingFace account to SpeechBrain for hosting your model card

## github workflow: strategy by configuration

API configurations are located at [.github/workflows](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/develop/.github/workflows)
<br/>_(all creating a one-time ubuntu-latest environment)_

---

Info: although our PyTorch requirements are
```
torch>=1.9.0
torchaudio>=0.9.0
```
our tests cover one PyTorch version only, _the latest_.

The versions of tools used/hooked in these checks are controlled via [lint-requirements.txt](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/lint-requirements.txt), a nested dependency in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/requirements.txt).
With major version releases of SpeechBrain, the versions of each hook should be updatedâ€”alongside requirement consistency in source, testing & builds incl. running spell-checking.

_Note: [PyTorch statement](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) on Python versions (as of 2022-11-09)_
> _It is recommended that you use Python 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8_
