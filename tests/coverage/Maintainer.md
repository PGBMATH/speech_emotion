# Maintainer checks for releases

Up until here, all the above madness should have settled.
Commit logs outline what happened; features are summarized.

_Note: a good point to check https://speechbrain.github.io/ is up-to-date._

The task at hand is:
* change the version number;
* compile a changelog, and
* release the latest version.

The specific process for a new release on PyPI is outlined elsewhere, here context is provided; key message: another CI/CD lifecycle begins.
